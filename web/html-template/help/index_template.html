  <h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Collective Bid Optimizer (CBO) automatically
    adjusts the bid price for bidding on AppNexus to meet 
    a specified delivery goal.  It consists of a CBO &quot;bidder&quot; 
    program to do the bidding, a user interface for managing and 
    controlling the bidder, and a monitoring program that monitors the 
    progress of the campaigns that are being bid on. 
    </p><p>
    The CBO bidder runs automatically every hour on the hour.  It takes
    from 30-45 minutes to complete.  During this time
    the bidder downloads information for <em>all</em> of the 
    campaigns that are currently on AppNexus, whether or not they 
    are being optimized, and records this data in a database.
    When the bidder encounters a campaign 
    that is being optimized it uses a &quot;bidding policy&quot; to 
    determine what to do.
    The bidding policy is specified for each campaign on the CBO dashboard. 
    The bidding policy may cause the bidder to change the bid price, 
    change the daily impression limit, or to do nothing depending on its 
    internal rules. 
    There is a special bidding policy called <a href="#ecp">ECP</a>
    that indicates the CBO bidder should leave the bid price adjustments 
    to AppNexus using the AppNexus Estimated Clearing Price strategy.  Any 
    campaign whose bidding policy is set to <a href="#ecp">ECP</a> 
    is considered as not being optimized by the CBO bidder.
    The bidder only updates the bid type, bid prices,
    and optionally the daily impression budgets in AppNexus.
    All other information about the AppNexus campaigns must be managed 
    manually through the AppNexus UI.
    </p><p>
    Please note that because the bidder only runs once an hour, 
    any change to the bidding policy in the CBO dashboard will not take
    effect until the next time that the CBO bidder runs at the start of the
    next hour.
    </p>

    <h3>Daily Bidding Policies</h3>
    <p>
    Currently, the only supported bidding policies
    adjust a campaign's bid price only once a day.  These daily bidding
    policies are used because AppNexus supports a daily impression limit that stops 
    buying impressions after the limit has been reached,
    and because there is typically a strong cyclical 
    variation of media demand and impression volume throughout the day.
    </p><p>
    The daily bidding policies bid only after all of the data from the
    previous day is available in AppNexus.  This allows them to
    set a single bid price for the day, and average over a complete 24 hour
    cycle.  The current bidding policies determine the bid prices 
    from just the previous day's worth of data, but more sophisticated
    bidding policies could be developed to take into account variations
    across days such as those seen between weekdays and weekends.  
    </p><p>
    Note that a &quot;day&quot; in this document means a day starting at midnight
    in the time zone of the campaign in AppNexus.  
    Most campaigns run in 
    &quot;Eastern Time&quot; (ET) which means Eastern Standard Time (EST) 
    or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) depending on whether or not daylight 
    savings time is in effect.
    </p><p>
    AppNexus typically takes about 2 hours following the last hour
    of the day to report all of the results.
    This means that the results for a given day for a campaign 
    that serves impressions to the end of the day,
    will not be available until about about 
    2 AM the following day (in the time zone of the campaign).  
    Because of this, the bid prices of
    most campaigns are adjusted at around 2 AM.  
    However, for campaigns that hit their daily impression 
    limit before the end of the day AppNexus may have the total 
    daily results earlier, so the bidder may bid earlier.  
    The current bidding policies are only
    allowed to adjust bid prices between 6 PM and 7 AM in the time zone of 
    the campaign.  Therefore, most changes that the user makes in the 
    CBO bid optimizer will not affect the bid price until the 
    start of the following day.
    </p><p>
    See the <a href="#biddingPolicies">Bidding Policies</a> 
    section for a more detailed
    description of each of the available bidding polcies.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="screens"></a>Screens</h2>
   <p>
   The CBO web application consists of the screens described below.  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#status">Status Screen</a></li>
    <li><a href="#dashboard">Bidder Dashboard</a></li>
    <li><a href="#charts">Campaign Performance Charts</a>
    <li><a href="#changes">Campaign Change History by Advertiser</a>
    <li><a href="#messages">Show Messages</a>
  </ul>
   </p><p>
   When a user first logs in, the user starts at the status screen which shows
   the last time the bid optimizer ran and its current state.  
   The other screens can be navigated to by choosing the desired screen 
   from the dropdown list on the top of the page.  The name of the current
   screen is always shown in the center at the top of the screen, and 
   there are logout and help links at the top right of the screen.
   Users should log out when they are finished using the CBO application 
   in order to ensure the highest level of security.
   </p>

  <h3><a name="status"/></a>Status Screen</h3>
  <p> The status screen shows the CBO version number, the last time the
      bidder process was successfully started, the server &quot;health&quot;,
      and the current state of the bidder if it is currently running.  The
      bidder state updates every few seconds on the status screen if the
      bidder is running.  The server is considered healthy if it can contact
      the CBO database, the user accounts LDAP server, and if the bidder has
      successfully run within the last 3 hours.
  </p><p>
      The bidder should run every hour.  
      If it has not started within the last hour there might be
      a problem with either the bidder application or with AppNexus.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="dashboard"/></a>Bidder Dashboard Screen</h3>
  <p> The bidder dashboard screen is the main control point for 
      managing campaigns.  
      This screen shows a large table containing information about
      the campaigns that are currently running on AppNexus. 
      Note that initially the screen may not show any data because
      no advertisers are initially selected in the advertiser selector 
      drop-down when you first get to the screen.  
      Choose the advertiser whose campaign you want to
      display or select &quot;All&quot; to show the data for all
      advertisers.   When there a lot of campaigns on this screen it may take a few
      seconds to refresh and load.
      </p><p> 
      The bidder dashboard screen is where you choose the bidding policy for each
      campaign.  The screen is mostly read-only except for the bidding
      policy, max bid, and daily impression limit columns.  If you make
      any changes on this screen you must press the &quot;save changes&quot;
      button on the top left of the screen to have the changes take effect.
      Clicking on any column header in the dashboard screen will sort 
      the entries in the table by that column. 
  </p>
  <h4>Controls</h4>
  <p>
      The controls at the top of the dashboard screen include a button 
      labelled  &quot;Save Changes&quot; to save any changes that you make, a
      button to download the contents of this screen as a spreadsheet,
      and drop-downs buttons that allow you to restrict the set of 
      campaigns shown on the screen by advertiser and bidding policy.
  </p>
  <h4><a name="tableCols"></a>Table Columns</h4>
  <p>
      Most of the columns in dashboard screen table are 
      self-explanatory.  They include the AppNexus advertiser and campaign, 
      but not the AppNexus line item.  We left out the line item for now 
      since the bidder can only optimize at the campaign level.  
  </p><p>
      Clicking on the campaign name will take you to the 
      <a href="#changes">campaign change history screen</a>
      to see the changes that have been made on the campaign.  
      Clicking on the little chart icon to the right of the campaign name 
      will take you to the
      <a href="#charts">campaign performance charts screen</a> where you
      can graph various metrics of the campaign over time.
  </p><p>
      After the advertiser and campaign columns come
      the start and end dates, the daily impression limit,
      the maximum and current bid CPMs, the bidding policy, 
      the lifetime impression target, the impressions served to date, 
      and a projected impressions column that shows how many impressions 
      the CBO estimates will be served by the end of the campaign.  The 
      projected impressions column is followed by a column that shows
      the percentage of the target lifetime impressions that are projected to
      be served.  This column is color coded to be green for campaigns that are
      expected to come close to their lifetime impression targets,
      blue for campaigns that are expected to under-deliver,
      and red for campaigns that excpected to over-deliver.
   </p><p>
      The lifetime impression projection is based on the number of 
      impressions shown prior to today, plus the impression rate
      averaged over the time since the last material change was made to
      the campaign times the amount of time left in the campaign.  
      Material changes include targeting changes, changes
      to the campaign lifetime impression targets, and bidding policy changes.
      The &quot;L/B&quot; (look-back) column is the number of hours since 
      the last material change.  Its value can be used to infer the level of
      confidence in the lifetime impressions projections.  
      Because of the cyclical variablity of the impression rate vs hour 
      of the day, look-back times less than 24 hours may not lead to very
      accurate lifetime impression projections.
   </p><p>
      The next few columns show the current daily impression target,
      the number of impressions served yesterday, and a 
      &quot;Daily Pacing&quot; column that is the ratio of these two
      as a percentage.
      The daily pacing column is also color coded using the same color
      scheme used for the projected lifetime impressions column.
      Please note that because the daily pacing column is the 
      impressions served <em>yesterday</em> divided by today's
      daily impression target, it might not be accurate if the
      daily impression target was changed significantly since yesterday.
      Also note that a campaign can be pacing differently on a daily
      basis than on a lifetime basis.  For example, if a campaign was
      serving a lot more impressions than needed every day since it
      started, but a lot fewer impressions than the daily target for
      today, the campaign could be over-pacing (red) on a lifetime
      basis while under-pacing (blue) on a daily basis. 
      </p><p>
      The final two columns show the total number of impressions served
      today (up to the last hour that AppNexus processed its data), and
      a column called &quot;Entropy&quot; that reflects how widely 
      the impressions were distributed across different web domains.
      Because AppNexus reports
      the data for the impressions served today at different times, 
      we have found that the column containing
      today&apos;s impressiona served is not very useful except to know
      that a campaign is serving impressions.
   </p><p>
      The entropy column is technically the mathematical entropy of the 
      distribution of impressions across sites from the previous day.
      The entropy takes into account both the number of sites and the
      distribution of impressions across sites, so, for example, a
      campaign that is serving 90% of its impressions to one site, and
      distributing the remaining 10% of its impressions to thousands
      of other sites will have a much lower entropy than a campaign
      that is serving roughly the same number of impressions to all of
      its thousands of sites.  For entropy,
      smaller numbers indicate more narrow distributions and larger
      numbers indicate broader distributions.  Because of this we have
      also color coded the entropy colum to be red if the site entropy
      is small (bad) and green if it is large (good).
   </p><p>
      One way to think about the site entropy is as follows:
      If all impressions were distributed uniformly across 2<sup>n</sup>
      sites, then the site entropy would be n.  For example, if we
      distributed impressions uniformly across 8 = 2<sup>3</sup> sites
      then we would get an entropy of 3.  If we distributed the
      impressions uniformly across 128 sites then the entropy would
      be 7 (because 2<sup>7</sup> = 128).
   </p><p>
      Because the typical distribution of impressions
      across sites decreases rapidly as some power-law of the number of
      sites, we never see a uniform distribution of impressions.  
      We typically see site entropies of only 6 or 7 even when we
      are serving impressions to over 1,000+ sites.  
      Of course, if we distributed all impressions to just one site the
      entropy would be 0 because 2<sup>0</sup> = 1. 
      For now, any entropy number less than 3 is considered to be 
      concerning since it like serving impressions uniformly over
      only about 8 sites.
   </p><p>
   </p><p>
  </p>
  <h4>Setting the bidding policies</h4>
  <p> The dashboard screen is the single place were you control how the bid
      optimizer works.  First you should select a bidding policy for the
      campaign from the drop-down list of choices provided.  The details
      of how these policies work are described in the 
      <a href="#biddingPolices">bidding policies</a> section.
   </p><p>
      If any bidding policy other than <a href="#ecp">ECP</a> is chosen
      the Max Bid column will be editable and you are required to set a
      maximum CPM price above which the CBO will not bid. Setting the
      maximum bid here is required even though there may already be a
      maximum bid in AppNexus because once the CBO takes control of the bidding
      AppNexus no longer honors the previous maximum bid price that was 
      specified when bidding <a href="#ecp">ECP</a>.  
      If the campaign was previously bidding
      <a href="#ecp">ECP</a>, the Max Bid column will be defaulted 
      to the max bid from AppNexus,
      but because this data is maintained in two different places it can
      sometimes get confused, so it is extremely important that you check
      the maximum bid price every time you change the bidding policy.
  </p><p>
      If a bidding policy of <a href="#daily">Daily Impressions</a>
      is chosen, then the daily impression limit column will become editable.  
      Like the maximum bid, the daily impression limit is set in both
      AppNexus and in the dashboard.  Therefore the value in this column
      will default to whatever is currently in AppNexus, and you should
      confirm this number prior to saving your changes.
  </p><p>
      Remember, if you have made any changes on the dashboard screen 
      you must press the &quot;Save changes&quot; button at the top of 
      the screen and wait for the screen to reload to ensure that you 
      have actually saved the changes.  
      Also note, your changes will not be reflected in AppNexus until 
      the next time the bidder runs and considers the campaign(s) 
      that you have changed, so you may want to check back with 
      AppNexus after an hour or so to make sure it has been correctly updated.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="charts"/></a>Campaign Performance Charts Screen</h3>
  <p> The campaign performance charts screen lets you graph and download
      the statistics on how the campaign has been performing on an hourly
      or daily basis.  It lets you select the advertiser and campaign
      at the top of the chart, the time zone, the time scale, 
      and the start and end date/times for which you want to graph the data.  
  </p><p>
      You select the campaign whose data is to be graphed from the 
      campaign chooser drop-down control.  If you want to see the data
      charted for more than one campaign you can check the &quot;Yes&quot;
      radio button next to the &quot;Multiple campaigns&quot; prompt
      and this will change the drop-down control into a list from which
      you can make multiple selections using the usual shift-click or 
      control-click multi-selection mechanism.
      The default setting is to allow you to only see one campaign at a 
      time because showing multiple campaigns with all of their metrics
      can result in a confusing chart.
  </p><p>
      The time zone defaults to the time zone of the campaign in AppNexus,
      but you can choose a different time zone by clicking on the
      &quot;Explicit timezone&quot; radio button
      and by selecting the desired time zone in the corresponding list.
      Typically you will want to show the data in the time zone that the
      campaign is running in because the daily impression cap set by
      AppNexus resets itself at midnight in the time zone of the campaign.
      Note that if you use an explicit time zone, the time zone will be
      represented as a fixed hourly offset from GMT and will not change
      even if there is a change to or from daylight savings time in
      the middle of the range of data.
  </p><p>
      Next you select whether you want hourly or daily data.  There is
      some support built-in for weekly, monthly, etc but it has not been
      fully tested.
  </p><p>
      After selecting the time scale the page will refresh with the choices
      of start and end dates/times you can select from.  When the time scale
      is hourly, the chart will include data that starts at the beginning
      of selected start hour, up to and including data to the end of the
      selected end hour.  For example, to select all of the data on an hourly basis 
      for 6/4/2012 you would set the start and end dates to 
      2012-06-04, the start hour to 00:00, and the end hour to 23:00.
      To select all of the data on a daily basis for both 6/4 and 6/5
      you would select 2012-06-04 as the start date and 2012-06-05 as the end
      date.  Note that the date format specifies the year-month-day in that order.
  </p><p>
      The checkboxes in the measures section of the screen allow you to 
      choose what metrics you want to be plotted as a function of time.
      The following metrics are supported:
      <ul>
	<li>Impressions Served</li>
	<li>Impression Target</li>
        <li>CPM (price paid)</li>
        <li>Bid price</li>
        <li>(Site Distriubtion) Entropy</li>
        <li>Changes</li>
      </ul>
  </p><p>
      The impressions served metric is the actual number of impressions
      served during the hour or day that starts at the time associated 
      with the data point.  The impression target metric is the 
      target number of impressions to be served during the associated day 
      when a daily time scale is used.
      If an hourly time scale is used the impression target is the daily
      target divided by the number of hours in the day.  Both of these
      metrics are integer values and are plotted against the left Y axis
      of the chart.
  </p><p>
      The CPM metric is the actual price paid in CPM ($/1000 impressions),
      and the bid price is the bid price in CPM for that hour.  For those 
      times when the bidding policy is ECP (e.g. CBO is not managing the 
      bidding) the bid price will be represented as $0.00 on the chart.
      The CPM and bid price metrics are both plotted against the right Y
      axis of the chart and are measured in dollars.
  </p><p>
    The site distribution entropy metric shows how the impressions were
    distributed across sites.  See the description of the 
    <a href="#tableCols">entropy column</a>
    in the dashboard table for more details on what the site
    entropy is.  If the site entropy is shown it is plotted against
    a third Y axis that appears to the right of the graph.
  </p><p>
    Finally, you can also choose to plot the times there were changes made
    to the campaigns on the chart.  These appear as small markers on the
    chart that can be clicked on to take you to the changes for the campaign
    on the <a href="#changes">campaign change history screen</a>.
    </p><p>
      Normally the chart is shown as a Java Applet at the bottom of the
      screen.  However, if you do not have Java, the chart can also be
      displayed as a static image by clicking the "Show Chart as Image"
      button.  This image can be saved to your local computer for including
      it in presentations by right-clicking on it after it has finished downloading.
      You can also download the data that is plotted in the chart
      as a spreadsheet by clicking the "Download Spreadsheet" button.
      </p>
  </p>
  <h3><a name="changes"/></a>Campaign Change History Screen</h3>
  <p> The campaign change history screen shows the changes made to campaigns
      over time as recorded hourly by the CBO bidder.  
      When you first select the campaign change history screen it shows
      a list of all of the advertisers in AppNexus.
      Clicking on an advertiser brings you to a screen that shows the
      changes sorted first by campaign, and then by date.
  </p><p>
      Campaign changes are divided into two types based on the way they are 
      reported by AppNexus.  These different types of changes are listed 
      in two columns to the right of the time column on the screen.
      You may need to scroll your browser window horizontally to see the 
      second column of changes because often the first column is very wide.
  </p><p>
      The leftmost column of the table is the time at which the change was
      noticed.  Note that this is the time when the CBO bidder program noticed
      the change, not the time that the change was made in AppNexus.  Because
      of this, you can only tell that a change was made before this time.
      The time is displayed in Pacific Time.
  </p><p>
      Many of the changes will just be bid price changes, or daily impression
      target changes made by the CBO bidder.  These are all listed in the left
      column of the table.  The right column contains changes to targeting.
      All changes are represented by a red strike-through of the old value
      with the new value appearing in green immediately to the right of the
      old value.  Sometimes changes that are shown in the very right column 
      are reversed (red to green) because of the way AppNexus represents 
      them internally.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="messages"/></a>Show Messages Screen</h3>
  <p>  The show messages screen allows you to see the messages generated by
       the monitoring program.  These messages are generated once per day
       in the early hours of the morning at about 3:30 AM Pacific Time for now.
       The messages are grouped into two categories:  Warnings and 
       notifications, and are then grouped alphabetically by advertiser and
       campaign.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <h2><a name="biddingPolicies"></a>Bidding Policies</h2>
   <p> The various bidding policies are described below.
       A bidding policy of <a href="#ecp">ECP</a> means that the Collective
       Bid Optimizer will leave the bidding to AppNexus using the AppNexus
       &quot;Estimated Clearing Price&quot; policy.
   </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#ecp">ECP</a> - AppNexus calculates the bid</li>
    <li><a href="#daily">Daily Impressions</a> - Targets a specified number of impressions per day</li>
    <li><a href="#lifetime">Adjustable Daily Impressions</a> - Targets a lifetime impression goal</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="ecp">ECP Bidding Policy</a></h3>
  <p> This stands for the &quot;Estimated Clearing Price&quot; policy
  that is provided by AppNexus.  If selected, AppNexus will compute the bid
  price required to win most of the bids using the maximum bid price in 
  AppNexus.  We typically use this policy in conjunction with a 
  maximum daily impression budget set in AppNexus to make sure a 
  campaign serves the same number of impressions each day.
  When a campaign is bidding ECP, the CBO bid optimizer does not 
  change anything in AppNexus, although it continues to record the 
  campaign's historical data from the hourly AppNexus downloads.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="daily">Daily Impressions Bidding Policy</a></h3>
  <p> The daily impressions bidding policy attempts to find a bid price in
  AppNexus that will cause AppNexus to serve exactly the number of
  impressions specified in the daily impression target 
  by the end of each day, ideally without hitting the daily impression limit.
  When this policy is selected the daily impression target field in 
  the dashboard screen is enabled and the user is expected to fill this
  in with the desired number of impressions to be served each day.
  Setting the daily impression target in the CBO dashboard will also
  set the daily impression budget in AppNexus to the same value.  
  This will prevent AppNexus from exceeding this target on any given day.
  </p><p>
  The daily impressions bidding policy differs from ECP in that 
  the CBO bidder sets a fixed bid price for the day in AppNexus, 
  and then every day it attempts to adjust that fixed price 
  so that it serves just the daily impression target impressions
  by the end of the day.
  </p><p>
  When the user changes the bidding policy from ECP to 
  daily impressions, the CBO bidder sets the AppNexus bidding type to
  &quot;fixed price&quot;, the AppNexus bid price to the maximum bid 
  specified in the CBO dashboard, and the AppNexus daily impression
  budget to the daily impression target specified in the CBO dashboard.
  Note again that this change does not occur until the next hour that 
  the CBO bidder runs following the change in the dashboard.
  This bid price is then continued throughout the remainder of the day.  
  If, at the end of the day, the same bid price has been used for more
  than 80% of the impressions served, then the CBO bidder will adjust the
  bid price at the start of the next day.  
  Otherwise, the CBO bidder bids at the maximum bid price for 
  <em>another full day</em> before considering how to adjust the bid price.
  Since in most cases the change in bidding policy from ECP to daily impressions 
  happens in mid-day, the bid price is usually not changed until the
  end of the <em>day after</em> the day in which the bid price is changed.
  This gives the bidder the chance to measure the impression rate at
  the maximum bid price so that it can estimate what bid price will be
  needed to serve impressions for all 24 hours of the day.  
  Because the bidder also sets the daily impression budget in AppNexus, 
  there is no harm in bidding at the maximum bid price since
  AppNexus will not serve more than the daily impression budget 
  worth of impressions in any given day.
  </p><p>
  The daily impressions bidding policy can save a significant amount 
  of money over the ECP bidding policy for some campaigns because often the ECP
  policy bids too high.  
  The ECP bidding policy serves a consistent number
  of impressions from day to day for these over-pacing campaigns 
  because it pays a lot for the bids in the morning and then hits
  its impression limit sometime in mid-day and stops bidding.
  The daily impressions policy tries to reduce the bid price so that
  AppNexus just barely serves the correct number of impressions by the
  end of the day without going over the limit.
  </p><p>
  Consider the following example. Suppose there is a campaign that is running ECP
  that is paying $1.00 CPM for up to 100,000 impressions per day, and
  suppose that all of those impressions are being served within the first
  12 hours of the day.  For this ECP bidding the total cost is $100 per day
  and there are roughly 100,000/12 = 8,333 impressions served per hour.
  </p><p>
  When the bidding policy is changed to the daily impressions target policy,
  the CBO bidder initially sets a fixed bid price to the maximum bid for the
  first day.  If the maximum bid is $1.20 CPM then the first day the CBO bidder
  will also serve 100,000 impressions but perhaps will serve them over just
  10 hours at a rate of 10,000 impressions per hour at a total cost of $120.
  However, the next day the bidder will see that a bid price of $1.20 results 
  in 10,000 impressions per hour (on average) and it will reduce the bid
  price proportionally to achieve the desired rate of 100,000 impressions
  in 24 hours:
  <br/>
  <center>new CPM = $1.20 (the old CPM) * 4,167 / 10,000 = $0.50</center>
  <br/>
  If this estimate is right, we will end up serving 100,000 impressions in 
  exactly 24 hours at a CPM of $0.50 for $50 total, resulting in a 50% savings over ECP!
  This cost savings can then persist until the end of the campaign.
  We have found that such a 50% savings is common for many, but not all,
  campaigns in AppNexus depending on whether the campaign is able to 
  deliver all of its daily impressions when bidding the ECP.
  </p><p>
  The daily impression target policy has one slight problem, however.
  It often slightly under-shoots the daily impression target by about 5%.
  This is because on those days where there are slightly too few impressions
  available at the computed bid price, we sometimes serve a few less impressions
  than the daily impression target.
  However, on those days where there are more than the average number of
  impressions available at the computed bid price, the number of impressions 
  served is limited by the daily impression budget set in AppNexus.  Since
  the AppNexus daily impression budget is the daily impression target, the
  daily impression target bidding policy sometimes serves too few impressions
  in a day, but it never serves too many impressions in a day.  The resulting
  statistical skew results in a slight under-delivery on average in these cases.
  </p><p>
  Another slight problem with the daily impressions target policy
  is that a person has to monitor the campaign manually every day to
  make sure that the daily impression target is always the correct value
  that will be required to serve all of the impressions by the end of 
  the campaign.  This problem, and the undershooting problem are 
  addressed by the adjustable daily impressions target policy
  discussed below.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="lifetime">Adjustable Daily Impressions Bidding Policy</a></h3>
  <p>
  The adjustable daily impressions bidding policy was designed to overcome the
  slight imperfections in the daily impressions policy.  The adjustable
  daily impressions policy is the same as the daily impressions policy
  except that it a) sets the AppNexus daily impression budget (e.g. impression limit)
  to 125% of the desired daily impression target, and b) re-calculates the daily
  impressions target each day to ensure that the lifetime impression target
  goal is met.
  </p><p>
  Setting the daily impression limit to 125% of the daily impression target
  allows the optimizer to go slightly over the target number of impressions
  in addition to going under the target number of impressions when there 
  are fluctuations in the impression inventory available at the fixed bid
  price.  This essentially eliminates the problem of the daily impressions 
  target under-shooting, while still putting a reasonable daily cap on the number of
  impressions served per day.
  </p><p>
  It is important now to distinguish
  the daily impression target from the daily impression limit.  In AppNexus
  these two are the same and are called the daily impression budget.  However,
  in the CBO these numbers are different.  The daily impression target and
  daily impression limit are both shown in the CBO dashboard, but when you
  look at AppNexus the daily impression <em>budget</em> will be the daily
  impression <em>limit</em> not the daily impression <em>target</em>.
  </p><p>
  The second difference in this policy 
  is to allow the CBO to set the daily impression target.
  It does this by simply dividing the number of impressions left to be
  served over the campaign's remaining lifetime by the number of days left
  in the campaign just before the CBO sets the bid price for the upcoming day.
  It uses this number as the new daily impression target for the day.
  </p><p>
  One consequence of this policy is that changes to the campaign end
  date or lifetime impression target can radically affect the daily impression
  target.  When these changes are detected, the CBO makes an exception to its
  usual rule of not bidding during the middle of the day
  to adjust the daily impression budget in AppNexus on the next bidder run
  if necessary.
  This allows a campaign that may be under-pacing on a lifetime basis, 
  but that could serve more 
  impressions on the day of the change, to serve more impressions as 
  soon as it can without having to wait for the next day.
  </p><p>
  <h4>Important Note</h4>
  In order to use the adjustable daily impressions target policy you must 
  make sure that the campaign end date and lifetime impression budget
  values are set correctly in AppNexus.  These values cannot be changed
  through the CBO dashboard user interface so you will need to log into 
  the AppNexus console to make these changes.
  </p><p>
  Also note that neither of these daily bidding strategies can save money when
  the campaign is not getting enough impressions at its maximum bid.  Typically
  both of these strategies end up costing a few percent more than ECP bidding,
  and serving a few percent more impressions, but the change is not 
  significant.  The only way to get a campaign to serve more impressions
  when it is under-pacing at its maximum bid is to either relax the targeting 
  restrictions or increase the maximum bid price.
